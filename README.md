Got it! Here's the updated and ready-to-paste `README.md` for your **Owl-Watch-pcd** project, now correctly reflecting:

* **Two models**:

  * **Model 1**: XGBoost (accuracy: 88%)
  * **Model 2**: CNN (accuracy: 93%)
* Uses **Django** for backend
* Uses **Flutter** for UI
* Uses **Kotlin** for Android services
* Integrates **Firebase** (Firestore + Auth + Storage)
* No screenshots included
* Structure inspired by [DDoS-Detection-With-AI](https://github.com/tahangz/DDoS-Detection-With-AI)

## üß† Overview

**Owl Watch** enables intelligent monitoring of children's mobile devices through a hybrid system that tracks app usage, locks apps after time limits, and captures screen activity for analysis. It uses **XGBoost** and **CNN** models to detect inappropriate or excessive usage patterns. All data and rules are stored and synchronized using **Firebase**.

## üß† ML Models

### 1. XGBoost Model
- **Goal**: Classify app usage patterns as normal or risky
- **Accuracy**: 88%
- **Inputs**: App name, session length, time of day, frequency
- **Use case**: Lightweight real-time predictions on-device

### 2. CNN Model
- **Goal**: Analyze screenshots for visual indicators of inappropriate content
- **Accuracy**: 93%
- **Inputs**: Screenshots (grayscale or RGB)
- **Use case**: Post-capture analysis using Firebase Cloud Function or backend script

---

## üî• Firebase Integration

- **Firestore**: Stores app time limits, usage history, and user configs  
- **Authentication**: Parent and child sign-in with email/password or Google  
- **Storage**: Uploads screenshots every minute from the Kotlin service  
- **Security Rules**: Separate access roles for parents and children

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chawkibenjmeaa/Owl-Watch-pcd.git
cd Owl-Watch-pcd
````

### 2. Backend Setup (Django)

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### 3. Flutter App

```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 4. Android Kotlin Service

* Open `/android_app` in Android Studio
* Grant permissions for `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, and `MEDIA_PROJECTION`
* Build and run the service on a child‚Äôs device

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

* Parent logs in via the web or app to configure time limits and monitored apps
* Child uses the phone as usual; usage is tracked live
* After exceeding limits, the app is locked
* Screenshots are taken every minute and uploaded
* The CNN model analyzes screenshots and flags them if needed

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

* Add live alerting to parent devices
* Implement GPS-based geofencing
* Integrate voice recognition for audio context
* Build reporting dashboard with daily usage trends
